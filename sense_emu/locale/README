To update the .pot template use the main Makefile in the project root:

  $ make sense_emu/locales/sense-emu.pot

To construct new translations, just use the standard gettext tools to create
new .po files in this directory. For example, to create a translation for
French:

  $ msginit -lfr_FR

Fill out the .po file accordingly, then the Makefile will take care of
construction of the .mo files during the package build. To update an existing
translation with updates from the .pot file:

  $ msgmerge -U fr_FR.po sense-emu.pot

To force construction of .mo files for testing, use "i18n" target of the main
Makefile:

  $ make i18n

Note that .mo files shouldn't be stored in the repo (the .gitignore already
excludes them), and likewise the .pot and .po files won't be included in
package builds, just the .mo outputs (see MANIFEST.in for details).
