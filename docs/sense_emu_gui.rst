The Sense HAT emulator application. This GTK application provides an
interactive interface for emulating the Raspberry Pi Sense HAT.

The main window is divided into four parts. At the top left is a visual
representation of the Sense HAT. Scripts using the emulator library
(:mod:`sense_emu`) to set the HAT's LEDs will display the result here.

At the top right, three sliders represent the temperature, pressure, and
humidity of the emulated HAT's environment.

.. important::

    The emulation does not *precisely* reflect the settings of the temperature,
    pressure, and humidity sliders. Random errors are introduced that scale
    according to the sensor specifications, and as the sliders are adjusted,
    the sensor value will gradually drift towards the new setting at a similar
    rate to the sensors on the real HAT.

At the bottom right of the window, a series of buttons are provided to emulate
the joystick on the HAT. The buttons will simulate *press*, *release*, and
*hold* events generated by the real joystick.

Finally, at the bottom left of the window, three sliders provide the
orientation of the emulated HAT in terms of yaw (rotation around the vertical Z
axis), pitch (rotation around the Y axis), and roll (rotation around the X
axis). Adjusting these sliders affect the accelerometer, gyroscope, and
magnetometer (compass) sensors on the emulated HAT. The emulated HAT assumes
gravity runs vertically in the direction of the Z axis (as in the real HAT),
and that North is in the direction of the X axis.

.. note::

    The emulator must be run prior to starting any scripts which expect to use
    the :mod:`sense_emu` library. However, the emulator can be terminated (and
    restarted) while scripts using the library are running (obviously, when the
    emulator isn't running sensor errors can't be emulated and all sensor
    readings will appear fixed). Attempting to spawn more than one instance of
    the emulator will simply activate the existing instance.
